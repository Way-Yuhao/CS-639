[backwardWarpImg]

Compute the mask by evaluating if backwarping traces back to the valid region of the unwarpped image.
Sample values by interpolation


[RANSAC]

given iteration limit and allowed error margin
for each run:
	randomly generate 4 source and destination point pairs
	computer Homography Matrix based those 4 points
	Apply Homography Matrix too all source points, count number of points transformed to a neighborhood within the true destination points within the error margin (L2 norm)
EndFor
return the H matrix with the highest amount of valid points


[blendImagePair]

computes weighted mask using bwdist() for both source and destination image
computes the output image using (Ws * Is + Wd + Id) (Ws + Wd) for every pixel location 


[stichedImg]
For input image (excluding reference img):
	run RANSAC to compute H
	apply backwarping to image to align with reference plane
	blend image with stitched image
	update mask for stitched image
EndFor
