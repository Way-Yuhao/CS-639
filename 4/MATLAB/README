[loadFocalStack]

loads all images in a given folder in the order that corresponds to their filenames


[generateIndexMap]

given the Laplacian method, we find the argmax of the SML matrix along axis 3. We then use an average filter to remove noise


[refocusApp]

we get coordinates from user input, find best focus frame from the depth_map, and then refocus to that frame.
